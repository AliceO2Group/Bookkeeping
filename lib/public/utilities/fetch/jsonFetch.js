/**
 * Send a request to a remote endpoint, and extract the response. If errors occurred, an array of errors containing title and detail is thrown
 *
 * The endpoint is expected to follow some conventions:
 *   - If request is valid but no data must be sent, it must return a 204
 *   - If data must be returned, the json response must contain a top level "data" key
 *   - If an error occurred, NO "data" key must be present, and there can be one of the following keys:
 *     - errors: a list of errors containing title and detail
 *     - error and message describing the error that occurred
 *
 * @param {string} endpoint the remote endpoint to send request to
 * @param {RequestInit} options the request options, see {@see fetch} native function
 * @return {Promise<*>} resolve with the result of the request or reject with the list of errors if any error occurred
