# Usage
This library serves as a GO API client to the O2 bookkeeping system. 
API endpoints are documented in the directory ```go-api-client -> src -> 
BookkeepingApi.go```
There's also an example of the usage in `Example.go`

### API token
API token is loaded into the Bookkeeping request upon page load, and can be extracted by looking with the chrome inspector -> network -> reload page and fetch token from request. TODO: create fetchToken method.


# Generate API client
Generate the API client based on the OpenApi file in Bookkeeping, which can be found under ```spec -> openapi-source.yaml```.
For generating the Go source code, we use this online tool: https://editor.swagger.io/.
Simply paste the editted OpenApi file in the tool, and generate the Go client. The source code will be downloaded automatically, and can be replaced with the source code in the Bookkeeping project.

Generating source code with the [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) CLI tool (as is done with the cpp-api-client), has proven to be insufficient for generating the Go-client. Perhaps this will be fixed somewhere in the future. Added this line as a friendly reminder.
