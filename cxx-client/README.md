# Bookkeeping API module

## Installation

### aliBuild installation

Follow [this](https://alice-doc.github.io/alice-analysis-tutorial/building/) tutorial to install `aliBuild`.

First of all, you need to add a dependency on `bookkeeping-api` in alidist.
Then, install `BookkeepingApi` module in your working directory:

```
aliBuild build bookkeeping-api
alienv load bookkeeping-api/latest
```

##### Development

If you want to make changes to the source code initialise the development package first:

```
aliBuild init bookkeeping-api@master
```

and then load the environment using `alienv` and use `make` to recompile

```
alienv enter bookkeeping-api/latest
cd sw/BUILD/bookkeeping-api-latest/bookkeeping-api
make -j install
```

## Usage

The bookkeeping API is split in two different targets:

- `BookkeepingApi` that has no dependency and provide use-case specific functions

### Cmake

In order to use the client in your application you need to link the library with your executables. For example if you
have only one executable you can add:

```cmake
find_package(BookkeepingApi)

target_link_libraries(${EXECUTABLE_NAME} PRIVATE AliceO2::BookkeepingApi)
```
### C++ usage

The bookkeeping API's client can be requested from the provided factory by passing it the gRPC endpoint's URI:

#### Use-case specific services

```cpp
#include <BookkeepingApi/BkpClientFactory.h>
using namespace o2::bkp::api;

auto client = BkpClientFactory::create("[host][:port]");
```

If you have a local bookkeeping running, the URI should be `127.0.0.1:4001` (note the **absence** of protocol such
as `https://`).


Then the clients provides access to services which group API calls by context, for example `flp`, `run` and so on.

For example to update readout FLP's counters using a local JSON file you can use

```cpp
#include <BookkeepingApi/BkpClientFactory.h>
using namespace o2::bkp::api;

auto client = BkpClientFactory::create("[grpc-endpoint-url]");
client->flp()->updateReadoutCountersByFlpNameAndRunNumber("FLP-NAME", runNumber, nSubtimeframes, nEquipmentBytes, nRecordingBytes, nFairMQBytes);
```

**Both the client creation and service calls may throw `std::runtime_error` that should be caught**
