# Bookkeeping data model

## Introduction
This document describes the data model of the ALICE O2 Bookkeeping system.   
For simplicity, the following info is not described in this document: 
- internal AUTO_INCREMENT fields
- creation and update timestamp fields
- n-m junction tables

## Further explanations of fields tables

Concerning the **Update time** of the fields:
- At SOR: synchronously at Start of Run 
- At EOR: synchronously at End of Run 
- During Run: periodically during the run, normally to update/overwrite counters
- After EOR: asynchronously after the run finishes, normally by humans

Concerning the **Update key** of the fields, it indicates which key will be provided to know which database record to update. 

Concerning the **Update mode** of the fields: 
- Insert: direct insert via the API
- Replace: direct insert via the API, new value replaces existing one

## Runs

**Description:** A Run is a synchronous data taking time period, performed in the O2 computing farm with a specific and well-defined configuration. It normally ranges from a few minutes to tens of hours and can include one or many ALICE detectors. It provides a unique identifier for the data set generated during the run.   
**DB main table**: `runs`

## Log Entries

**Description:** Text message that describes a significant intervention or event that happened. Can be generated either by humans (e.g. a shifter enters his/her end-of-shift report) or by computer processes (e.g. AliECS stores a dump of the configuration parameters used) and are normally consumed by humans.
