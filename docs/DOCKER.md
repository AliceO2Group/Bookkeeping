# Docker

## Windows Subsystem for Linux
Note that there are some issue with version 2 of Windows Subsystem for Linux, so be aware. Especially the development environment has some issue due to file changes not always triggering an event inside the container.

## Unsatisfiable constraints
For achieving consistent builds, the dependencies you rely on must be pinned down to a specific version. Why is that? If you don't pin down version numbers, your images are dependent on the point of time when they are built. When package maintainers decide to release a new version, it will be automatically installed as soon as you rebuild your image the next time. Unfortunately Alpine Linux does not keep old packages. Thus from time to time GitHub Actions or the staging server will not built/update as the dependency (or dependencies) at that specific version cannot be found in the repository. To solve this read the error output and update the `Dockerfile` to match the newer version.
